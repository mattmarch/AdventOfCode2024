# Advent of Code 2024 in F#

## Download an input file

```bash
# e.g. For day 03
./downloadDayInput.sh 3
```

Ensure input files are in the `Input` directory (named `01.txt` and so on) and in the repo root run:
```bash
# e.g. for day 03
dotnet run --project AdventOfCode2024 3
```
or leave out the day number to run every day.
